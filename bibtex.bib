abstract = {The increasing shortage of fossil resources and environmental pollution has renewed interest in the synthesis of value-added biochemicals from methanol. However, most of native or synthetic methylotrophs are unable to assimilate methanol at a sufficient rate to produce biochemicals. Thus, the performance of methylotrophs still needs to be optimized to meet the demands of industrial applications. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion on the properties of natural and synthetic methylotrophs, and summarize the natural and synthetic methanol assimilation pathways. Further, we discuss metabolic engineering strategies for enabling microbial utilization of methanol for the bioproduction of value-added chemicals. Finally, we highlight the potential of microbial engineering for methanol assimilation and offer guidance for achieving a low-carbon footprint for the biosynthesis of chemicals.}

We report two complimentary strategies to further engineer a previously engineered methylotrophic E. coli strain for improved methanol utilization. First, we demonstrate improved methanol assimilation in the presence of small amounts of yeast extract by expressing the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) from Bacillus methanolicus. Second, we demonstrate improved co-utilization of methanol and glucose by deleting the phosphoglucose isomerase gene (pgi), which rerouted glucose carbon flux through the oxidative PPP. Both strategies led to significant improvements in methanol assimilation as determined by 13C-labeling in intracellular metabolites. Introduction of an acetone-formation pathway in the pgi-deficient methylotrophic E. coli strain led to improved methanol utilization and acetone titers during glucose fed-batch fermentation.}

abstract = {There has been a large increase in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 over the past century. The use of captured CO2 can become a profitable business, in addition to controlling CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A process for producing fuel grade methanol from captured CO2 is proposed in this paper. The process is designed and simulated with Aspen Plus. The CO2 is captured by chemical absorption from the flue gases of a thermal power plant. The hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis using carbon-free electricity. The methanol plant provides 36% of the thermal energy required for CO2 capture, reducing considerably the costs of the capture. The CO2 balance of the process showed that it is possible to abate 1.6 t of CO2 per tonne of methanol produced if oxygen by-product is sold, or 1.2 t if it is not.}

abstract = {This paper presents a computer aided system, which can be used for simulation, design and operation of membrane-based gas separation processes. The computer aided system consists of a general model for the membrane-based gas separation process and a robust, reliable and flexible method of solution. The mathematical model consists of equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, which allows the consideration of effects such as pressure drops and various flow patterns within the permeator. The method of solution for the set of differential equations employs orthogonal collocation and decouples the set of equations by linearization in order to facilitate the calculation of sensitivities. In the current implementation, membrane modules with cocurrent or countercurrent flows and permeate pressure drops can be handled. Numerical results covering examples of simulation of gas separation units and effects of different variables on the design and operation of these processes are presented.}

abstract = {This paper describes the performance of sulfonated aromatic poly(ether ether ketone) (S-PEEK) membranes, directly prepared from the sulfonated monomer, for CO2 separation from gas mixtures containing N2 or CH4. Dense membranes with different degrees of sulfonation were prepared via solvent evaporation. Increasing degree of sulfonation simultaneously improves the permeability and selectivity of both gas pairs. The effect of counterions was investigated by converting S-PEEK membranes from the Na+-form in which they are prepared, to the H+ and multivalent cationic forms. Gas permeability and selectivity for polymers with divalent and trivalent counterions were higher than those for polymers in the monovalent and H+-forms. In order to study the stability and potential industrial application of these membranes, they were tested at different conditions of feed pressure, temperature and CO2 feed concentration.}
