      There are a variety of regulative policies and policies in place that would
      impact the implementation and success of iGEM Toronto’s project. There are
      regulative politics in place that impact landfill sites that govern the
      maintenance, monitoring, and disposal of landfill gas. These regulatory
      policies were put in place in an effort to reduce landfill gas emissions in
      Canada, and govern at what size and capacity would landfill sites be required
      to monitor their landfill gas emissions and also dispose of the landfill gas.
      In order to educate individuals who are not familiar with the nuanced
      landscape of landfill gas regulation, our team created a summary of this
      framework:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    {{ subheading("Summary of the Regulatory Framework") }}
    <div>
      <p>
        Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 28 times
        of carbon dioxide. A source of this methane is from the decomposition of
        biodegradable waste in landfills, accounting for 24% of national methane
        emissions  in Canada. As such, in facing the dangers posed by methane,
        there is a regulatory framework in place aimed at reducing emissions from
        landfills. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Current Strategies") }}
      <p>
        The framework suggests implementing infrastructure and equipment at
        landfills to recover the gas and either flare it or use it for energy
        generation. Existing approaches are technically feasible, commercially
        available, and provide measurable methane emission reductions. Building
        from these current approaches, emerging strategies involve using specific
        landfill cover materials and designs to facilitate the biological
        destruction of methane that will produce less pollution and be more cost
        effective. iGEM Toronto is interested in being at the forefront of using
        synthetic biology to reduce the amount of landfill gas emissions in an
        environmentally safe and efficient way. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Implementation") }}
      <p>
        In implementing the landfill gas strategies discussed above, the
        regulatory framework proposes several key requirements:
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementation of a landfill methane control approach: Landfills
        exceeding a methane  generation or emission threshold would be required
        to implement a landfill methane control  approach. This could involve
        active or passive landfill gas recovery systems, methane  destruction
        devices, engineered biosystems (such as biocovers or biowindows), or
        landfill design  and operational plans to reduce methane emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Methane control monitoring and corrective action plan: Landfills
        subject to the regulations  would need to conduct regular monitoring
        of methane emissions and have a corrective action  plan in place to
        address any issues or leaks in the methane control systems. Increasing
        the frequency of monitoring and maintenance has been shown to enhance
        methane recovery and  emission reduction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Notifications, record keeping, and annual reporting: Landfills would be
        required to provide  notifications to the regulatory authority, keep
        records of methane control activities and  measurements, and submit
        annual reports on their methane emissions and control efforts. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Applicability Thresholds") }}
      <p>
        These regulations would apply to landfills based on the quantity of
        municipal solid waste (MSW) disposed of at the site. The applicability
        thresholds are as follows: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Closed landfills that accepted any quantity of MSW after January 1,
          2009, and have more than  450,000 tonnes of MSW-in-place.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open landfills that have more than 100,000 tonnes of MSW-in-place or
          have accepted more than 10,000 tonnes of MSW for disposal per year
          after the regulations come into force. 
        </li> 
      </ul>
      <p>
        Landfills meeting these criteria would be required to conduct a methane
        generation assessment  using a designated model and report the results
        to the regulatory authority. If the landfill's annual methane
        generation exceeds a specified threshold of 664 tonnes per year, the
        regulations would  require the implementation of a landfill methane
        control approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exemptions may be granted based on measured methane values. For
        landfills without existing  methane control systems, they can be
        exempted if the methane concentration at or above the  landfill surface
        is below specified thresholds. Closed landfills with existing gas
        recovery systems  may be exempted if methane concentrations in the
        recovered gas and surface emissions are  below specified thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine compliance with thresholds, the regulations propose using
        drone-based and  ground-based methane concentration measurements.
        Drone-based surveys would be conducted at  specified intervals, while
        ground-based measurements would verify exceedances identified by the
        drone-based method. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework acknowledges that further development and validation of
        measurement methods  and thresholds are necessary. Stakeholders are
        invited to provide data and information to support this analysis. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Improvements to the Framework") }}
      <p>
        The proposed framework aims to align with Canada's commitment to
        reducing methane emissions, as outlined in the Global Methane Pledge
        and the Faster and Further: Canada's  Methane Strategy. The regulations
        seek to achieve the greatest feasible reductions in landfill  methane
        emissions and improve monitoring and mitigation practices. Feedback on
        the proposed  regulatory framework was invited until May 19, 2023, to
        inform the development of the  regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various requirements for the operation, maintenance, and monitoring
        of landfill gas recovery  systems and methane control approaches are as
        follows: 
      </p>
      <div>

            The plan should include monitoring for landfill methane recovery
            systems, biosystems (biocovers), and methane leaks. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Landfill owners have flexibility in setting action thresholds for
            some parameters, while  certain thresholds will be specified in the
            regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The plan should define procedures for follow-up actions when

      {{ subsubheading("Introduction") }}
      <p>
        Pollution is defined as the introduction of harmful substances into the
        environment and can be categorised as either air pollution, water
        pollution, or land pollution. In particular, air pollution from
        greenhouse gases is a major concern due to its association with global
        warming {{ cite("national_geographic_pollution") }}. Greenhouse gases such as carbon
        dioxide and methane absorb sunlight reflected from the earth’s surface,
        trapping heat in the atmosphere via the greenhouse effect. Although
        this greenhouse effect is a natural process, recent human activities
        have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the
        atmosphere, causing rising global temperatures {{ cite("national_geographic_pollution") }}. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Landfill gas occurs due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic
        materials such as food and paper deposited at landfill sites
        {{ cite("eccc_reducing_methane_emissions_landfills") }}. As of today,
        solid waste landfills are responsible for a staggering 23% of Canada’s
        total methane emissions. Instead of allowing methane to escape into the
        atmosphere, methane can be collected within landfill sites using a
        series of vertical and horizontal pipes. The methane is then collected
        at a central site where it can undergo treatment and be used to
        generate electricity or create fuel. Alternatively, the landfill gas
        can also be burned in a process known as “flaring” to create carbon
        dioxide, which has a lower impact on the greenhouse effect than methane
        {{ cite("epa_basic_information_landfill_gas") }}. According to a survey
        done by the Government of Canada in 2020, approximately 1,401
        kilotonnes (kt) of methane were generated from Canadian landfills
        {{ cite("eccc_waste_greenhouse_gases") }}. Of this amount, only 418 kt,
        roughly a third, of it was captured (30%)
        {{ cite("eccc_waste_greenhouse_gases") }}.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident that new regulations and technologies are necessary to
        reduce methane emissions in Canada. More landfill sites should begin to
        capture methane in an effort to reduce the environmental impact of our
        garbage. Furthermore, greener, more clean solutions for utilising
        methane gas should be considered in lieu of flaring, which still
        introduces a greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) into the environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        iGEM Toronto’s 2023 project, named “Methanivore”, aims to engineer
        bacteria capable of consuming methane and methane derivatives, such as
        methanol, formate, and formaldehyde, and implement this system in
        landfill sites. To do this, the methane from landfill gas will be
        isolated and then oxidized to methanol. This methanol will serve as a
        carbon feedstock into methylotrophic strain bacteria. The bacteria that
        feed on the methanol will also have to be cultivated on an industrial
        scale to effectively remove methane from the landfill gas ecosystem.
        The Toronto iGEM’s hardware team aims to design a separation process
        for the landfill gas, a process for oxidizing the resultant methane
        gas, and a fermenter to cultivate the methylotrophic bacteria at scale,
        while the wet lab and dry lab team are utilizing a variety of
        experimental techniques to enhance the assimilation of single-carbon
        compounds in our engineered strains using overexpression, CIRPSR-Cas
        system knockout, and adaptive evolution. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Regulatory Landscape and Risk Assessment") }}
      <p>
        To the best of iGEM Toronto’s 2023 team’s knowledge, the application of
        genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to manage landfill gas emissions
        has not been previously explored. However, current research offers
        valuable insights into engineered methanotrophs, a field our team is
        actively expanding upon in our project. Past studies have investigated
        the utilization of genetic tools to research and optimize methanotroph
        physiology, aiming to enable metabolic engineering for converting
        methane into valuable bioproducts {{ cite("puri_tools_buryatense") }}
        {{ cite("jeong_toolkit_biorefinery") }}.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the research techniques the team is employing, such as
        CRISPR-Cas9, are vital for optimizing methane conversion, the true
        bioethical and regulatory challenges arise not within the laboratory
        setting, but when considering the real-world implementation of these
        engineered methanotrophs at landfill sites. Therefore, there are a
        variety of bioethical considerations and perspectives that our team
        considered during the creation of our project, which are discussed
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of GMOs in Canada extends into various industrial processes and
        consumer goods within Canada and are included in a category of
        approximately 23,000 different substances that are utilized in the
        country. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure public health and environmental safety, Health Canada and
        Environment Canada jointly established the <i>Canadian Environmental
        Protection Act</i>, 1999 {{ cite("gc_cepa") }}. This legislation
        mandates a thorough risk assessment of environmental and industrial
        products, including those that are utilized in biotechnology. The
        product is evaluated for its potential risk against both human health
        and the environment, and if it is toxic. A substance is considered to
        be toxic if it enters or may enter an environment where it can pose a
        risk to human health, the environment (such as wildlife), and
        environment in which wildlife depend on, such as water, air, or soil. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to separate chemicals and other products from biotechnology
        products involving living organisms, a specialized section of the CEPA
        1999 act addresses the threat and risk assessment of these entities.
        This section requires information from companies or manufacturers
        regarding the organism’s identification, characteristics, exposure,
        and any potential health threats to humans or to the environment. While
        iGEM Toronto believes that our engineered methanotrophs pose no threat
        to human health, there are some considerations when weighing the
        potential environmental risk of our organisms to the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineered methanotrophs, modified within the confines of a lab, cannot
        be deemed native to the local environment. Methanotrophs naturally
        inhibit various ecosystems, such as in rice fields, wetlands, sewage
        treatment facilities, and landfills {{ cite("sip_testing") }}. It can
        be expected that each geographical region may have different
        predominant and local species of methanotrophs, resulting in each
        location having its own unique biological footprint. Consequently, the
        potential introduction of genetically engineered methanotrophs may
        jeopardize the natural diversity of methanotrophs at a landfill site if
        they were to escape confinement within our hardware system and
        outcompete native strains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concern about engineered methanotrophs outcompeting local strains
        underscores the importance of preserving nature’s biodiversity, since
        it is unlikely that the exposure of engineered methanotrophs would
        cause long lasting environmental damage that could potentially impact
        the ecosystem. In fact, previous researchers have contemplated the
        deliberate introduction of engineered methanotrophs directly into the
        soil at sites for soil remediation {{ cite("ge_methanotroph_bioaugmentation") }},
        and waste water treatment {{ cite("methanotrophs_applications") }},
        and in coal mines to mitigate high methane emissions
        {{ cite("methanotrophs_bioengineering") }}
      </p>

    <div>
      {{ subsubheading("Conclusion") }}
      <p>
        The iGEM Toronto 2023 team, “Methanivore”, worked on an innovative and
        unique project by introducing genetically modified organisms into a
        landfill gas collection system—a unique application in the field. Given
        the stringent regulations surrounding genetically modified organisms
        and synthetic biology, our team dedicated significant effort to
        comprehensively research the regulatory and bioethical dimensions of
        our project, with the aim of demonstrating our project’s viability for
        real-world implementation beyond the laboratory. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In Canada, the utilization of genetically modified organisms is highly
        regulated under the 1999 Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This
        legislation requires companies, manufacturers, or other entities to
        prove that their chemical, product, or living organisms pose no threat
        to human health or the environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While our project poses no direct harm to human health, we acknowledge
        valid environmental concerns regarding the potential consequences
        should our engineered methanotrophs escape into the landfill site. The
        engineered methanotrophs can potentially interbreed with native local
        strains, or competitively displace them, thereby affecting the local
        populations. This concern extends to biodiversity preservation,
        emphasizing our commitment to safeguarding nature’s intricate
        ecosystems, regardless of their size and big or small.  
      </p>
      <p>
        While assessing the risks of our hardware system and project, our team
        has come to the conclusion that the chances of our engineered
        methanotrophs escaping our hardware system are minimal, reducing the
        risk of contamination or leakage. Nevertheless, we advocate for a
        proactive stance by endorsing the importance of well-defined spill
        cleaning procedures at landfill sites. These procedures encompass the
        use of materials designed to absorb spills, having biohazard disposal
        bags, and disinfects, all which serve as a contingency plan to swiftly
        address and solve any unforeseen incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the iGEM Toronto team, "Methanivore," recognizes the
        importance of addressing regulatory and bioethical considerations when
        exploring novel applications of genetically modified organisms in
        landfill gas collection systems. While there are potential
        environmental concerns regarding biodiversity, the team's risk
        assessment indicates a low likelihood of escape from our system. We
        emphasize the imperative need for proactive bio spill cleaning
        procedures, reinforcing our commitment to responsible and secure
        implementation of our innovative solution in the world.
